    "text": "1.1 Conceptualization and Mathematical models\nConceptualization is a process through which we idealize an engineering problem in the physical reality. The error induced due to the conceptualization is called the error due to the idealization.\nThe goal of conceptualization is to identify the simplest mathematical model that can provide predictions of the data of interest within a specified range of accuracy. In other words, the error due to the idealization should be as small as possible.\nA numerical simulation requires an underlying mathematical model. Mathematical models are mathematical description of the idealized problem, which we have obtained through the process of conceptualization. In mechanics, these mathematical models are described by the sets of differential equations and boundary and initial conditions. These differential equations are collectively called as the governing equations of the problem.\nFurther, the development of a mathematical model is not a trivial task, and following questions often help us in preparing the mathematical model.\nFor example, in solid mechanics, we often estimates displacements, stresses, strains, natural frequencies, etc., for a given computation domain, stress-strain model, and boundary conditions. The mathematical model is given by a set of partial differential equations (PDEs), which are obtained by satisfying:\nThe mathematical model obtained by satisfying the above conservation principals will yield a general description of the problem in the mechanics. These governing equations are valid for solids, liquids, and gases. However, in my opinion these models are computationally useless unless we make valid assumptions to simplify them to an extent so that they are computationally feasible. These assumptions are made while considering the material behavior, mode of deformation, dimensional reduction, etc.\nFor example, the usual beam, plate and shell model (theory) are special cases of a model based on the three-dimensional linear theory of elasticity, which in turn is a special case of a large family of models based on the equations of continuum mechanics. This is what we called the Hierarchic view of mathematical models.",

    "text": "1.2 Validation\nAt this point we know that a mathematical model represents the idealization of an engineering problem. Therefore, every mathematical model has some error due to this idealization (or conceptualization). Validation is a process by which the numerical results of a mathematical model are tested against the experimental data. Through validation process we can estimate the error of conceptualization and we can have an idea about the predictive capabilities of the model.\nIf the error induced by the model is smaller than tolerance limit, then we can say that the model has passed the validation test. Otherwise, we need to improve the mathematical model until it passes the validation test.\nDepending upon the problem, such as design of an aircraft or design of a concrete dam, a series of validation experiments are performed. These validation experiments include the determination of physical properties and failure criteria for entire structure, sub-components, parts, etc.\nWhile assessing the results of validation experiments it is important to consider the limitations and uncertainties associated with the available information concerning the physical system being modeled.\n\nThe computation domain is usually assumed to corresponds to design specification. In reality, parts, sub-components and assemblies can deviate from their specifications and the degree of deviation may not be know, or would be difficult to incorporate into a model. For example, a concrete dam or earthen dam has many components, joints and heterogeneity, which may be too complex to include in a mathematical model.\nThe exact spatial-temporal distribution of the material properties may not be known accurately. Moreover, for many materials the constitutive laws are not known accurately.\nThe boundary conditions may not be known with a high degree of precision.\nThe magnitude of residual stresses inside the material may be not be known.",

To get this answer, in the above variational form, let us put \\(\\delta u=u\\) and assume that \\(u\\) vanishes at the boundary:\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{L}\\frac{d u}{dx}\\nu\\frac{du}{dx}dx+\\int_{0}^{L} ukudx=\\int_{0}^{L} f(x)dx\n\\]\nNow we can see that both \\(u,\\frac{d u}{dx}\\) should be finite in order to get finite value of integrals on the left hand side.

It is worth noting that the test function \\(\\delta u\\) vanishes at those points where \\(u\\) is prescribed.\nThere is way to deal with the essential boundary condition. In this method we write the solution as follows\n\\[\nu(x) = u_f+u_p\n\\]\nwhere, \\(u_{f} \\in E^{0}[0,L]\\), that is, it vanishes at the boundary. We can select \\(u_p\\) such that \\(u\\) satisfy the boundary condition. Usually, \\(u_p\\) depends upon the boundary value of \\(u\\).
